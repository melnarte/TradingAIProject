# Trading AI project
In this project I'll reproduce machine learning based quantitative trading papers and try to apply them for real trading. Feel free to give any suggestion and to contribute to the project.

## Data collection

For easy historical data collection I use a free IEX cloud account : https://iexcloud.io/

## Papers

Some reference papers can be found under the papers directory. Here are the ones than will be reproduced :
- [Time-driven feature-aware jointly deep reinforcement learning for financial signal representation and algorithmic trading, Kai Lei 2019](https://github.com/Boubside/TradingAIProject/blob/master/papers/Time-driven%20feature-aware%20jointly%20deep%20reinforcement%20learning%20for.pdf) : Uses the high representation capabilities of supervised learning to represent the state of the environment and the decision making ability of reinforcement learning for portfolio management to achieve high profits. Also introduce a lot of interesting concepts like Gating (effectivally weighting features) and Attention mechanisms.
